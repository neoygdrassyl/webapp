# WEB APPLICATION README

Some details about the application.

The way it does the authentication, is by using the index.php form, to set the session variables as needed.

Then checks this on the login.php page to continue towards the list.

It is evident the controllers and pages do not have any sort of user validation, so it is possible to access any page through the url path as normal, in order to focus on the requirements given, these sort of considerations are left aside.

For the list.php page, I have decided to use JS for the reponsiveness of the page, this considering this was going to be a page list and that no further CRUD functionaities were going to be used given the requirements.

Considering grammar, there may be some mistakes, both in pages and in code, currently, I work in two dictionaries, english and spanish, and more often than not it is a russian roullete wich one VS code is going to use, so I may have some mistakes here and there reggarding this. I sincerely appologize.
